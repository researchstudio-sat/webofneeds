The Agreement protocol provides means for the communication partners to establish and manage a set of agreed-upon RDF triples as a result of communication acts. Each partner can calculate the set of triples solely based on the communication history. The acts are *stating*, *proposing*, *accepting*, *claiming', *rejecting* and *proposing to cancel*. Stating is simply the act of sending a Message containing some RDF triples; the other acts are executed by referencing earlier messages using the object properties in this ontology.",
