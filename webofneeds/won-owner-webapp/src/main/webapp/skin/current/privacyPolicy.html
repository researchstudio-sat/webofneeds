    The protection of your personal data is very important to us. Therefore we process your data exclusively on the basis of
    the legal regulations (GDPR, TKG 2003). In this privacy policy we inform you about the most important aspects of data
    processing within our website.
</p>
<h2>Contact us</h2>
If you contact us via the form on the website or by e-mail, your data will be stored for six months to process the request
and in case of follow-up questions. We will not share this information without your consent.

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    We point out that for the purpose of maintaining your Posts on the site, we associate a user account with the e-mail address
    you provide. The e-mail address is not made publicly available. We do not associate information about your ip address
    or location with your user account. We associate your user account with the Posts you create, but only internally.
</p>
<p>
    You should note that the posts you create are publicly visible on the WWW under their respective URL, for the purpose of
    matching them with other posts. Without the information you provide, we are not able to provide matches. As there is
    no public information about the association of user accounts to posts, we don't consider posts to be personal data. If
    you choose to enter personally identifiable information in posts, you do so knowing that it will be publicly available.
</p>
<p>
    As posts are publicly available, third parties can download your posts and analyze them for the sake of matching. We do not
    conclude any data processing contract with those third parties.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to your posts, data about their connections with other posts ("conversations") is also made publicly available,
    including the information about the last update date and time, the state (connected, closed, request received, request
    sent, suggested). Making this information public allows third parties to analyze which posts are good matches for each
    other.
</p>
<p>
    The messages you exchange with other users are only visible to you and the user you are communicating with. They are, however,
    stored in clear text on our servers.
</p>
<p>
    Posts are archived (status is changed to 'inactive') after a period of 10 days, or when you archive them manually, but they
    remain publicly available so that a) other users can verify the conversations they had with that posting and b) third
    parties can use this data for improving their matching algorithms.
</p>


<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    Our website uses so-called cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your device using the browser. They do
    no harm.
</p>
<p>
    We use cookies to make our offer user-friendly. Some cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. They allow
    us to recognize your browser on your next visit.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not want this, you can set up your browser so that it informs you about the setting of cookies and you allow this
    only in individual cases.
</p>
<p>
    Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website.
</p>

<h2>Web analytics</h2>
<p>
    Our website uses the web analytics software Piwik, hosted on our own Servers in Austria. For this purpose, cookies are used
    that allow an analysis of the use of the website. The information generated thereby is transmitted to our Piwik server
    and stored there. Piwik is open source software created by Matomo (https://matomo.org).
</p>
<p>
    You can prevent this by setting up your browser so that no cookies are stored.
</p>
<p>
    The data processing takes place on the basis of the legal regulations of the &sect; 96 Abs 3 TKG as well as the Article 6
    Subsection 1 f) legitimate interest of the GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    Our concern in the sense of the DSGVO (legitimate interest) is the improvement of our offer and our website. Since the privacy
    of our users is important to us, the user data are pseudonymized. Moreover
</p>
<p>
    The user data is kept for the duration of 30 days.
</p>

<h2>Emails</h2>
<p>
    You post on our Website with the intention of communicating with other users. In order to notify you of messages you receive
    while not logged in, we send emails to the address you provide in your user account. You can set your email preferences
    in your account settings (including disabling all notifications).

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>
    You have the rights to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, revocation and opposition. If you
    believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or if your data protection claims have otherwise
    been violated in a way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the data protection authority.
