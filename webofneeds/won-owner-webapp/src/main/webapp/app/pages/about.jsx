            An atom is much like an automatic classified ad. You say what you
            are looking for, and other such ads will be matched with yours. You
            could think of it as of a long-lived search query that can itself be
            found by others. Once you found a useful match, you can connect to
            it and start to chat.

      " forwarded to the next processing node, signatures are added by " +
