    " counterpart's WoN node and your counterpart's Owner Application. Each one of" +
    " these communication channels are secured with TLS, so the data is encrypted as it is transmitted. Once your" +
    " messages reach your Owner Application, they are signed using asymmetric cryptography so your counterpart can " +
    "verify that the message was written by the same person who created the need in the first place. As messages are" +
    " forwarded to the next processing node, signatures are added by " +
    "the receiving node. Messages sent later contain the signatures of earlier messages, so it becomes impossible " +
    "to change the content of messages or pretend they were never sent or received." +
    " The Owner Application creates a new key pair for every need you" +
    " create, so others should not be able to find out which needs are yours and which needs are from other" +
