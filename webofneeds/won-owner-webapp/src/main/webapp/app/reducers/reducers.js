     * combineReducers above parcels out the state to individual
     * reducers that deal with their slice on their own. Sadly not
     * all updates can work like this. Occasionally there's cross-cutting
     * concerns between parts of the state. These can be addressed in
     * this reducer.
     *
     * **How to use me:**
     *
     * * Try not to create new branches of the state here (this is
     *   what combineReducers is for)
     * * Make sure the actual methods updating a respective part
     *   of the state are in the js-file responsible for that part
     *   of the state. This is to ensure that all write-accesses
     *   to the data can be discerned from that one file.
     *
     * @dependent state: https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/749
     *
     * also, if you need to resolve the data-dependency just for
     * a component, you can use [memoized selectors]
     * (http://rackt.org/redux/docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html)
