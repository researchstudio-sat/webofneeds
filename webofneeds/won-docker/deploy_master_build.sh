# this image creates a keypair and a certificate based on it and stores the respective files as in the specified
# folder (see parameter of option '-v'). If different certificates are to be created for different images
# (e.g. owner and node), they should be put in different folders and these images should mount those different
# folders where needed (e.g. for tomcat, that folder is '/usr/local/tomcat/conf/ssl/', as used e.g. in the run
# command of the wonnode). Note that the filename of the certificate is also used in the tomcat config, (see
# owner/ssl/server.xml) so be careful when changing it.
