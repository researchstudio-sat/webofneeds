 * Trust on first use strategy: if certificate is already known and trusted
 * (from previous communication) - trust it. If not yet in the store, and we can
 * successfully add it to the store (no alias collision based on the provided
 * alias generator) - trust it. Otherwise - don't trust. For example if we have
 * already the certificate under the same alias in the store - we don't trust it
 * because we already trust that other certificate (alias should represent the
 * certificate owner unique id, e.g. for server it is usually the authority, for
 * client can be anything). User: ypanchenko Date: 05.08.2015
