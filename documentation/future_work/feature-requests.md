# Feature Requests

## Group Chat
Useful for many use cases in which it's about a 1:N or M:N communication situation, e.g.:
* the people who share an atom don't know yet that they are a group
* a solution has to be worked out by the group
* a solution has to be executed by the group
* the group engages in social interaction

## Identity (Avatar) Management
Requested by just about anyone who tries the demonstrator. 

## Feedback Form
Simple feedback form or any other functionality to allow users to report problems with the owner webapp.

## No-chat Atoms
In some cases, users just need information, and it would be nonsensical to start to chat with the item that is matched that contains the needed information. We used to think that WoN is not a system for satisfying pure information needs, but it may be worth thinking about atoms that don't allow connecting - and in that case, displaying them differently.

## Configurable Expiration Date
Currently we have a default expiration date. Allowing users to set one would be more appropriate in many contexts.


## Contexts configurable in skin definition
For a given instance, it makes sense to pre-define matching contexts and to offer those predefined contexts (e.g. in a drop-down list) when posting. These could be added quite easily to the skin definition.

## Disconnect from WoN
In some use cases, atoms of an instance should not be matched with atoms on other instances. More fine-grained control over this aspect is needed in order to cover such cases.
