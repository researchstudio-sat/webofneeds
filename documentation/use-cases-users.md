# WoN use cases from the perspective of a normal user
Here are some use cases from the perspective of a normal user who uses the original (nonpersonalized/nonmodified)
web of needs system.
#### Use Case 1: Finding a mate for playing table-football
You are planning to play table-football with two colleagues this afternoon.
Since four players are needed for playing table-football, you post your ‘atom’ for another mate on web of needs,
you need to find another mate.
If someone else has posted (or posts) a ‘atom’ that ‘matches’ your ‘atom
of doing something together’, you will be notified by the web of atom.
Then, you can request the other person to start a chat to set up your
table-football event. Have fun! ;)

#### Use Case 2: Giving away your old sofa
Do you want to give away your old sofa? It’s very easy using the Web of Needs.
You express that you are ‘supplying’ your sofa.
You can describe the features of your sofa and specify when you have time
for a pickup appointment. If someone has expressed a ’demand’ for a sofa
that matches with yours, both of you will be notified. One of you will
request to start a chat and you can manage the rest together via chat system
of the Web of Needs . ;)

#### Use Case 3: Finding a copy of Charles Darwin’s  book “origin of species”
You need to read the origin of species for your biology class.
You wonder, whether someone gives away her old copy.
So, you post your ‘demand’ on the web of needs.
If there is someone who gives away her book, you will be notified and can start a chat together and
organise who to pick it up. Too easy? ;)

#### Use Case 4: The bus no. 68 is often late
The neighbourhood that you live in is too dark in nights and atoms more light.
You express your ‘critique’ on this matter in the Web of Needs.
If there are other ‘matched’ critiques, you will be connected to others and
can start a chat with them. Do your best to find a solution! ;)
